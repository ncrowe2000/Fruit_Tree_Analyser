# Fruit_Tree Analyser

# Description
This JavaFX program allows the user to upload an image of fruit which is then rendered in the program's GUI. The user must then click on one of the pieces of the fruit in the image so that the program stores the fruit's colour as a hexadecimal code. The user can then convert the image to black and white and/or draw borders around all the fruit in the image, provided they are the same fruit as the one the user clicked as the program uses the stored hexadecimal code to know what to draw the borders around. The program then returns the number of pixels present within each border.
